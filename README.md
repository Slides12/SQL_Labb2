# SQL_Labb2
Second laboratory in SQL

This is a WPF application who uses the database we created in the first laboratory.
I have provided the .bak file in the SQL_Labb2\Sql Backup folder. This needs to be restored.

You will also need to add a user secret with the following key/value pair:

  "ConnectionString": "Initial Catalog=DanielJohansson;Integrated Security=True;Trust Server Certificate=True;Server SPN=localhost"

To be able to connect to the database.
